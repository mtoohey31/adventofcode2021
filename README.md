| 1   | C        | I still haven't gotten around to learning C yet, and while I'm sure it'll get harder once I have to deal with more complex data types, since I could perform the computation as I read the file, this as pretty painless!                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2   | Go       | Go is pretty nice! There are only two things I can nitpick: the error messages aren't quite as nice as something like Rust, and I do miss some of the functional methods, though maybe there's a module that allows for those in Go. After using it for this day, I decided to use it in one of my personal projects, [gh-foreach](https://github.com/mtoohey31/gh-foreach).                                                 |
| 3   | Dart     | It took me a surprising amount of time to figure out how to read a text file with Dart, but that's understandable since, from what I know, it's mainly used as part of Flutter for mobile development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4   | Rust     | I've used Rust a lot before, and I really like it. The code I wrote for this day was pretty messy though, it could probably be done far more elegantly. be                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | Ruby     | Ruby felt a lot like Python in many ways, though I I prefer the syntax in some ways, and I yet again enjoyed the more functional methods, though I suppose these can be approximated by comprehensions in Python.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 6   | Clojure  | This was the first language so far that I really felt was "something different". Since Clojure is a functional language, and I've never used a functional language before, it definitely took some adjusting to. My first few versions of a solution, while they worked, were pretty bad and non-functional, as in, though they worked, they were fighting against Clojure's functional nature instead of making use of it. This day probably took me the longest so far, and I've refactored the result multiple times. |
| 7   | F#       | F# also has a lot of functional features, though it's nowhere near as purely functional as Clojure. Again, like Dart, it was surprisingly challenging to figure out how to read some text. F# doesn't really have the same excuse as Dart here, but it may just have been me. I feel like there are a lot of features of F# that I don't really understand; I have no prior experience with any .NET languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8   | Fish     | I've also used Fish a decent amount before. I lucked out in choosing it for this day, because it didn't end up requiring hash maps or anything like that. Even though Fish just a shell, it's surprisingly elegant and functional for actual programming, as long as you're not using complex data types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 9   | R        | R does some interesting things, like having operations apply element-wise to vectors and such. I've used it a decent amount in my university stats courses, and those features can be super handy for that kind of thing, but it was just a pain to use for standard programming. This day took me almost as long as day 6 with Clojure, and for that one I had to learn not only a completely new language, but also a whole new programming paradigm, whereas I've used R quite a bit before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10  | Elixir   | Now we're talking! I found Clojure really interesting, but I think its just a little bit _too functional_, at least for my tastes. Elixir, at least in the way I used it for this problem, seemed like a very good happy medium. The map literal syntax is a little weird (though I prefer that to having to deal with `set()` in Python for creating empty sets because `{}` is taken by dicts), and I also found the requirement of having to define functions inside modules a little strange, there's probably a good reason for that though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
